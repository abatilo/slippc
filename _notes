Slippi Replay Browser Source:

Changes from raw replay files:
  - Follower combined into player as bitmask +4
    < e.g., _player=5 = port 1 nana, _player=6 = port 2 nana, etc.

Quirks / Bugs:
  - In game combo counter does not reset between stocks IF opponent is hit on the first frame invincibility runs out after respawning
  - Have to add 1 to each character in CSS tags to display properly
  - Hitstun counter seems to decrement by powers of 2 (not just by one) when hitstun is active

Possible stuff to add:
  * Ensure Ice Climbers have sensible stats computed by analyzer
  - Invincible / intangible attack option counter
  - Meteor cancel hit / miss rate
  - Actions / inputs per minute
  ? V-cancel stats
  ? Shield drop stats
  ? Friendly button names (rather than bitmasks) in debug output
  ? Factor in LRAS initiator to account for game wins / losses
  ? Add console nickname to parser / analyzer as applicable
  ? Filter for vs. CPU matches
  ? Filter for looking at a particular player
  ? Meta-analysis stuff
