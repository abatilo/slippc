  https://github.com/project-slippi/project-slippi/wiki/Replay-File-Spec

Goals:
  - Human parseable JSON you can open in a text editor
  - ...you can parse however you want with any JSON tools

Possible Compression / Expansions:
  * Gzip compression
  * Deltas between pre-frame / post-frame on a per-character basis
  + Ignore unknown frame data
  + Delete spaces in output JSON
  + Shorter field names
  x Show / hide human-readable data (e.g., char names / action states)
  x Show computatble metadata
