Quirks / Bugs:
  - In game combo counter does not reset between stocks IF opponent is hit on the first frame invincibility runs out after respawning

Possible stuff to add:
  * Ensure Ice Climbers have sensible stats computed by analyzer
  * [Maybe] recover replays with raw-data reported as 0 bytes
  - Timer / tournament legal settings check
  ? Actions / inputs per minute
  ? Amsah techs
  ? Item catches
  ? Projectiles shot / hit
  ? Improve reverse edgeguard detection (currently counts SDs while edgeguarding as reverse edgeguards)
  ? Friendly button names (rather than bitmasks) in debug output
  ? Factor in LRAS initiator to account for game wins / losses
  ? Add console nickname to parser / analyzer as applicable
  ? Filter for vs. CPU matches
  ? Filter for looking at a particular player
  ? Meta-analysis stuff
  ? Add characater-specific stats (e.g., Kirbycide count, Peach's items pulled, Yoshi parries)
