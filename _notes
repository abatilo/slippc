Quirks / Bugs:
  - In game combo counter does not reset between stocks IF opponent is hit on the first frame invincibility runs out after respawning
  - Have to add 1 to each character in CSS tags to display properly (Shift-JIS problems)

Possible stuff to add:
  * Handle Shift-JIS encoded tags (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JIS_X_0208 + http://x0213.org/codetable/iso646irv-jisx0213-8bit.txt ?)
  * Ensure Ice Climbers have sensible stats computed by analyzer
  * [Maybe] recover replays with raw-data reported as 0 bytes
  * Add characater-specific stats (e.g., Kirbycide count, Peach's items pulled, Yoshi parries)
  - Timer / tournament legal settings check
  ? Jab Resets
  ? Actions / inputs per minute
  ? Ledge dashes / invincible / intangible attack option counter [need to look at frame history]
  ? V cancels
  ? Amsah techs
  ? Item catches
  ? Projectiles shot / hit
  ? Improve reverse edgeguard detection (currently counts SDs while edgeguarding as reverse edgeguards)
  ? Friendly button names (rather than bitmasks) in debug output
  ? Factor in LRAS initiator to account for game wins / losses
  ? Add console nickname to parser / analyzer as applicable
  ? Filter for vs. CPU matches
  ? Filter for looking at a particular player
  ? Meta-analysis stuff
