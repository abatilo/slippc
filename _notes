Changes from raw replay files:
  - Follower combined into player as bitmask +4
    < e.g., _player=5 = port 1 nana, _player=6 = port 2 nana, etc.

Quirks / Bugs:
  - In game combo counter does not reset between stocks IF opponent is hit on the first frame invincibility runs out after respawning
  - Have to add 1 to each character in CSS tags to display properly
  - Hitstun counter seems to decrement by powers of 2 (not just by one) when hitstun is active
